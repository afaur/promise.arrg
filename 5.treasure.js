// Pirates want treasure!
const { crew, capin } = require('./.arrg')

// 5) Give one treasure to your crew and keep the rest for yourself!
// TIP: call `treasure.giveToCrew()`, or nothing to keep it!
// TIP: You can use `Array.reduce()` to reduce an array to a single item! Like
//      finding the smallest one.
