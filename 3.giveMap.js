// Pirates want treasure!
const { crew, capin } = require('./.arrg')

// 3) Try giving your crew a treasure map! They'll find the treasure for you!
// TIP: call `crew.findTreasure(treasureMap)`
// TIP: be sure to `catch()` things just in case something breaks!
// TIP: If you `console.log()` a treasure you can see it's size!
